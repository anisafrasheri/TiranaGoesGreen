# TiranaGoesGreen

## Overview

Welcome to the **TiranaGoesGreen**, an Urban Reforestation and Sustainable Transportation Platform! This project leverages space technologies and data from the Copernicus Sentinel-2 satellite to enhance urban reforestation and promote sustainable transportation. By identifying areas with reduced vegetation and encouraging the use of bicycles, we aim to reduce carbon emissions and foster a greener urban environment.
üèÖProudly awarded third place in the 7th CASSINI Hackathon in Albania.

## Features

- **Vegetation Monitoring:** Uses NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index) data from Sentinel-2 L2A to identify deforested regions.
- **Tree Planting:** Allows users to donate for tree planting in identified areas.
- **Cycling Promotion:** Encourages the use of bicycles over cars to reduce carbon footprint.
- **Carbon Footprint Reporting:** Tracks and reports reductions in carbon emissions through tree planting and cycling.

## Technologies

- **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript:** For building the front-end user interface.
- **Python:** For server-side processing and data handling.
- **Copernicus Sentinel-2 Data:** Utilized for vegetation analysis (NDVI Layer).

## How It Works

1. **Data Collection:** The platform uses Sentinel-2 satellite data to analyze NDVI and identify areas with reduced vegetation.
2. **User Interaction:** Users can view areas needing reforestation and choose to contribute through donations.
3. **Sustainable Choices:** Users are encouraged to switch to bicycles for transportation, reducing their carbon footprint.
4. **Reporting:** The platform provides carbon footprint reports based on user actions and contributions.
